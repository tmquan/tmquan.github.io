His developed algorithms focused on unsupervised learning techniques by introducing a fast alternating method for reconstructing highly undersampled dynamic MRI data using convolutional sparse coding which can be 2D or 3D. The proposed solution leverages Fourier Convolution Theorem to accelerate the process of learning a set of filters and iteratively refine the MRI reconstruction based on the sparse codes found subsequently. In contrast to conventional Compressed Sensing methods which exploit the sparsity by applying universal transforms such as wavelet and total variation, my approach extracts and adapts the related information directly from the MRI data using compact shift-invariant filters. The reconstruction outperforms CPU implementation of the state-of-the-art dictionary learning-based approaches by up to two orders of magnitude.\

Recently, he has been working on Deep learning-based Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for reconstructing Compressed Sensing MRI, classifying X-ray images, and segmenting Computed Tomography data.
